This project documents using the "Sockets" API in C for network programming.
It's purpose is to accompany academic textbooks on network programming,
giving useful examples.

In particular, the purpose is to document things missing from textbooks.
A good example is "SIGPIPE": every program using TCP needs to handle
this signal. This complication is largely ignored by textbook, and not included
in their examples. This leads to students writing code that occasionally crashes
mysteriously.
